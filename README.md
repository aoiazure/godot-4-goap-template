# Godot 4 GOAP template

A modified and somewhat expanded version of Vinicius Gerevini's [godot-goap](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini/godot-goap/) project. As such, it has similar asterisks: it is not heavily stress-tested and there may be some odd edge cases. Many thanks to him and his work.

This template expands on the original shifting to **typed functions** and **named classes**, allowing for better autocompletion and strictness to minimize errors.

To keep this template lean, there are no example files included; please refer to Vinicius's original project and video for examples. 

Feel free to modify as needed.
